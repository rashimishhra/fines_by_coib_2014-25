            <h1>NYC Department of Education, Health System Lead in Ethics Violations Since 2014; Misuse of Position Most Common
            </h1>
            <p class="subhead">Despite increased ethics waivers under Adams' administration, city departments face mounting conflict-of-interest fines, with Department Of Education racking up 120 violations while De Blasio's unprecedented penalty of about half a million dollars stays outstanding

        <p>A recent analysis of data released by New York City's Conflict of Interest Board (COIB) in January 2025 reveals that city departments have paid substantial fines for ethics violations between 2014 and 2025, with the Department of Education leading the city agencies.</p>
        <p>The Department of Education paid the highest, approximately $300,000 in fines across 120 separate violations over 11 years. This significantly outpaces other departments in frequency of violations, though not always in severity of individual fines. The Health and Hospitals Corporation follows closely behind with $250,000 in total fines, despite being penalized only 58 times, less than half as frequently as the Education Department.</p>

        <p>The various ethics violations that result in fines fall into several categories. Misuse of city position, accounted for over $260,000 in fines, the highest monetary category. It happens when public servants use their official positions to obtain financial gains, contracts, licenses, privileges, or other personal advantages for themselves or associates. Misuse of city resources, the most frequently cited violation, involves public servants using city property, equipment, or other resources for non-city purposes, including political activities or personal business.</p>
        <p>Other violations include, misuse of city time, when city employees conduct personal business or other non-city activities during their official work hours. Job seeking violations happen when public servants receive compensation from anyone other than the city for performing official duties, or accept gratuities from individuals whose interests may be affected by the public servant's official actions. Aiding or inducing a violation, was also the major category, involves encouraging or helping another public servant to violate ethics rules.</p>

        <p>One standout case involves former Mayor Bill de Blasio, who served from 2014 to 2021. In 2023, the COIB ordered de Blasio to pay half a million dollars for conflict of official duties and misude of city resources after determining he had used taxpayer dollars for political purposes. This record-setting penalty included compensation for police officers' travel expenses and a $155,000 fineâ€”the largest ever issued by the COIB. <a href = "https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/15/de-blasio-historic-fine-00102213">According to Politico's December 2023 report</a>, this unprecedented sum has yet to be paid. In contrast, the Mayor's Office itself has only paid $28,000 in fines over the entire 11 year period.</p>
        <p>While the COIB can fine up to $25,000 per violation, some departments have faced even steeper penalties for multiple violations in single cases. The Health and Hospitals Corporation and the Kings County District Attorney's Office each paid $40,000 in fines in January 2024 and March 2018, respectively for combinations of violations including misuse of city time, resources, and position.</p>
        <p>The total amount paid in fines has increased over time, from approximately $140,000 in 2014 to nearly $200,000 in 2024. This increase comes despite a significant rise in waivers granted under Mayor Eric Adams' administration. <a href = "https://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/eric-adams-city-workers-record-number-conflict-of-interest-waivers/5987630/">According to a November 2024 NBC New York report</a>, an average of 748 city employees per year have received authorization to own or work for private entities that transact with the city under Mayor Adams, a 61% increase over the de Blasio administration and a 219% increase from the Bloomberg and Giuliani administrations.</p>
        <p>When questioned about this trend, Mayor Adams defended the practice, citing the competitive job market, "If individuals need a waiver that I have to approve and then it is approved by the oversight agencies to make sure it's done correctly, then I have to do that to attract the talent that I need to run the city."</p>
        <p>As ethics oversight continues, the question remains whether increased enforcement or greater leniency through waivers will shape the city's approach to conflicts of interest in the years ahead.</p>
